Running ARGoS for the first time

To test your ARGoS installation, you need to download the examples(https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3-examples). You’ll find a README file that will guide through the features of ARGoS in a tutorial-like fashion.

To test ARGoS, get the examples, compile them and launch the most basic experiment available, diffusion_1.argos:

$ cd argos3-examples                      # go into example dir
$ mkdir build                             # create build dir
$ cd build                                # go into build dir
$ cmake ..                                # setup compilation
$ make                                    # compile
$ cd ..                                   # get out of build dir
$ argos3 -c experiments/diffusion_1.argos # launch experiment

A man page covering ARGoS' command line options is available:

$ man argos3
